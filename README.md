### What I learned

This project was the most challenging of all the projects I have undertaken to date. Despite the challenge, the satisfaction of completion was immense. It took me two days to complete it, which significantly deepened my knowledge of Next and Typescript.

### Continued development

I noticed that I had some difficulties with Types and Async Functions. Therefore, I decided to prioritize learning more about these two topics. This will undoubtedly help me better handle similar challenges in the future.
